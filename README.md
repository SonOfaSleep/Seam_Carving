Seam Carving. One of the projects from JetBrains academy.

This project was frustrating for me in many ways:
- While i was about to start it, war began in my country;
- It was hard af to push myself to do this project;
- At the time of the publication of this note, there is still a war going on in my country (more precisely, the 84th day of it);

So program. It is based on dynamic programming to search shortest path through matrix of pixel energyes.
