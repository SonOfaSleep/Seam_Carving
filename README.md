Seam Carving. One of the projects from JetBrains academy.

This project was frustrating for me in many ways:
- While i was about to start it, war began in my country;
- It was hard af to push myself to do this project;
- At the time of the publication of this note, there is still a war going on in my country (more precisely, the 84th day of it);

So program. It is based on dynamic programming to search shortest path through matrix of pixel energyes and resizing image by removing it.

The left matrix is matrix with pixel energies, right one is summed matrix in which one we search shortest path. This path is a seam that we are searching and going to remove. <br />

The results are like this: <br />
